 * Improvements
 ** drags and fill is fluid but weird. Some may think that 
dragging a component that is already on the map should move 
it. Can we make dragging the component ton the map move the 
component, and dragging the component from the list on the 
left fills the grid with the component?

 ** On the second page to create event, users do not like to 
have to click to go to the default map

 ** When editing pokemon stats, values should change as 
user scrolls across the possible levels (could make the sideboard automatically calls save)

 ** Users would like to see methods to transition from one map to another in one game 

 ** Functionality of auto populates a map with tiles and pokemons
when users do not feel like creating but want something new

 ** have to press save to get the new moves corresponding to the level 

 ** Have better way of specify user starting position

 ** Perhaps highlight for current editing pokemon? 
 
 * bugs:
 
 ** The editing windows gets smaller every time the user clicks something
 
 ** Users can drag and drop part of a thing 
 
 ** Scroll reset when editing pokemon for player
 
 ** player just shifts across the map without walking
