## Initial Workflow

To begin creating our program we will first focus on completing the necessary modules needed for the rest of the game engine which includes the map and the map creation which can be created independently as it isn't dependent on other modules - except perhaps for NPC placement but that can be introduced at a later stage. The other modules needed to be created first is the Pokemon and Items modules which are present in the inventory of the player and play an essential part in the battle. The player movement part of the Player module which is mostly front-end work can be done independently of the rest of the module, however the player module is next to be implemented once it has access to pokemon in the game and items. After this has been completed we will begin working on the battle component of the game in both front end and back end using the APIs we have already created.

## Initial Responsibilities
1. Player Model (Once Pokemon/Items API finished Dan will work on creating the model of the playable character, Nathan will handle back end component of player creation within creation environment and back end of player movement) - Dan + Nathan

2. Map/Data Backend (Initially work on back end component of map and methods to store that data, once complete move onto storing other data in the game e.g. player attributes)- Keegan

3. Pokemon/Items/Battle BackEnd (Pokemon and Items modules are to be completed first between Mason, YiQin and Dan, once these have been implemented, creating the turn based style battle and the algorithmic components behind that will be completed by all of sub-team)- Mason + Dan + Yiqin + Nathan

4. Menu/UI (Chenning will work on creating the Menu and UI flow so that the user can appropriately traverse the program) - Chenning

5. Map/Player Movement (Tony will work on implementing the front end for the map creation component and for the game engine, he will also initially help introduce the front end component of Player Movement)- Tony

6. Front End of Battle (Working alongside the battle sub-team Paul and Tony will create the visual component for the front end to be linked with the back end, another person may need to work here for integration of the two components) - Paul/Tony
