# VoogaSalad - Pokemon Game Creator (JavaFX)

Project that allows users to create their own Pokemon game and play it. Made as part of the Duke CompSci 308 class with 6 main contributors. I was heavily involved with programming the game engine and making edits to the authoring environment to introduce new features. Did both front and back end programming for the game engine and made some changes to the back end of the authoring environment aspect of the project.

The program allows you to drag and drop tiles to create your own maps and edit tiles to add events such as key items allowing for the development of quests, or trigger the opening of the shop to buy items or go to another user-made map. Drop pokemon and trainers onto the map and add dialogue, nick names and edit stats/moves. Then jump into the playing aspect of the program where you can run around your created map, encounter trainers and complete battles.

Pacman game engine needs to be developed, but utilizes same authoring environment allowing for creation of a map and dropping enemies.
